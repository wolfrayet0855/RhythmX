## Menstrual Phases (Quick Overview)

1. **Menstrual (Days ~1–5)**  
   - **Biology:** Low estrogen/progesterone trigger shedding of uterine lining.  
   - **Pregnancy Probability:** Very low (but not zero).  
   - **Common Symptoms:** Cramping, fatigue, irritability.  
   - **Tips:** Light exercise, warm compresses, nutrient-rich foods.

2. **Follicular (Days ~1–13, overlaps with Menstrual)**
   - **Biology:** Rising estrogen, follicles in the ovary mature, endometrium rebuilds.  
   - **Pregnancy Probability:** Moderate, increasing as ovulation nears.  
   - **Common Symptoms:** Improved mood, rising energy, possible boost in libido.  
   - **Tips:** Higher-intensity workouts, tracking cervical mucus/ovulation kits.

3. **Ovulatory (Around Day ~14 in a 28-day cycle)**
   - **Biology:** LH surge releases the egg; highest chance of conception.  
   - **Pregnancy Probability:** Peak fertility window.  
   - **Common Symptoms:** Elevated libido, mild pelvic twinges (Mittelschmerz).  
   - **Tips:** Ideal time for conception; stay hydrated and pay attention to bodily cues.

4. **Luteal (Days ~15–28)**
   - **Biology:** Progesterone rises, preparing uterus for potential implantation.  
   - **Pregnancy Probability:** Higher early on if fertilization occurs; declines otherwise.  
   - **Common Symptoms:** Possible PMS (mood swings, bloating, breast tenderness).  
   - **Tips:** Nutrient-dense diet, moderate exercise, stress management.
